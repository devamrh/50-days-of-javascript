# 01. <!-- Comment -->
// this is a inline comment

/* This is a multiline comment */

# 02. <!-- Data Types -->

1. undefined 
2. null 
3. bool
4. string 
5. symbol
6. bigint 
7. number 
8. object 

# 03. <!-- Varibles -->

- variable names can made up of numbers, letters,and symbols like $ or _
- varibale names shouldn't start with spaces or start with a number.


# 04. <!-- Assignment Operator  -->

- (=) it is the assignment operator
- it is used to store/assign values

# 05. <!-- Assigning One Variable To Another -->

- First you have to declare a variable then you have to assign it to the new one.

# 06. <!-- Intializing Variable With The Assignment Operator -->

- Initial the value in a single line

# 07.<!-- Declaring the string variable -->

- You have to declare a new variable with string.

# 08.<!-- Understanding Uninitialized Varibales -->

- undefined are special data types
- concatenating with undefined brings undefined.
- NaN means 'Not a Number'

# 09.<!-- Understanding Case Sensitivity -->
- the varibale names should be camelcase
- the structure should be proper

# 10. <!-- Differences between var and let keyword -->
- (var) can be overwritten but (let) cannot be redeclared.
- if you overwrite (let) it'll give an error
- (let) was introduced in ES6
- let is block scoped.
- var is function scoped
- let doesn't allow hoisting
- (Hoisting) means a fucntion or variable which can be used before declaration. 

# 11. <!-- Declaring a read only variable with const -->

- let can also be reassigned and updated but const is constant, it cannot be changed
- it has all feature like let but it's read only and cannot be modified.
- while using const you should UPPERCASE the variables.

# 12. <!-- Adding Two Numbers -->
- Javascript has a datatypes named as 'Number'
# 13. <!-- Mathematical Operators -->
- JS has mathematical operators like (+,-,*,/)

# 14. <!-- Increment Operator -->
- JS has increment operator (++)

# 15. <!-- Decrement Operator  -->
- JS has decrement operator (--)

# 16. <!-- Remainder Operator -->
- The remainder operator checks if a number is divisable by 2 .The result maybe odd or even.

# 17. <!-- Compound Assignment -->
- compound assignment example 
  - myVar+=5
  - myVar-=5
  - myVar/=5
  - myVar*=5

# 18. <!-- Escape Literals (\) -->
- Escape literals are (\) which helps to quote strings
  - example: "He said, \"I learned from freeCodeCamp!\"

# 19. <!-- Quoting with single literrals -->

- you can also use the single literal ('') and wrap them with double string.
- the common use of this is when <a> tag is used.
- the backslash(\) isn't needed that time.

# 20. <!-- Escape Sequence in string-->

- \'	single quote
- \"	double quote
- \\	backslash
- \n	newline
- \t	tab
- \r	carriage return
- \b	backspace
- \f	form feed

# 21.<!-- String concatenation -->
- String concatenation can be done using (+) sign between strings.
- you can also concat string variables.
- different type of varibale declaration can also be concatenated.(let,const,var)
- (.length) method is to find the length of string.
- ()
